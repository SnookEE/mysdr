\section{Clock Distribution} %(fold)
\label{sec:clock}

    Clocking is mainly supplied by a 25MHz FOX924B TCXO which has $\pm$2.5ppm frequency stability.
    The TCXO feeds a Silicon Labs Si5338 clock buffer/generation chip.  There are four outputs
    to this clock distribution chip which supply the following:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \hyperref[sec:adc]{RX ADC} Clock
        \item \hyperref[sec:dac]{TX DAC} Clock
        \item \hyperref[sec:db]{RF Daughterboard} Reference Clock
        \item 20MHz Reference for \hyperref[sec:dac-lpf]{Skyworks 73202 Programmable LPF}
    \end{itemize}
    
    The TCXO also supplies the main 25MHz reference for the \hyperref[sec:gige]{Gigabit Ethernet PHY} chip.
        
    \subsection{FOX801 High Precision VCTCXO} %(fold)
        There is an option to replace the relatively low cost FOX924B TCXO with a higher precision,
        low phase-noise FOX801 reference.  This VCTCXO can be calibrated using a frequency counter
        and adjusting the voltage output by auxiliary DAC \texttt{TBD}.  The stability of this 
        reference is the same $\pm$2.5ppm as the FOX924B.

    \subsection{External Frequency References} %(fold)
        In the case that either the FOX924B and FOX801 references are not good enough, an external
        frequency reference can be supplied which feeds into a secondary input to the Si5338.
        This input can then be used for generation of all the previously mentioned clock outputs.
        The input can be either single-ended or differential and applied to the SMA connectors \texttt{TBD}
        and \texttt{TBD}.  When supplying only a single-ended clock, terminate SMA connector to 
        ground \texttt{TBD} through $0\Omega$.
