\section{Power Supply} %(fold)
    
    Input should range from 7.5v to 40v and is fed into a 5V LDO that can supply up to 3.5A of current.
    This 5V source supplies the National Semiconductor DC/DC multi-output power supply which then supplies
    the 3.3V, 2.5V, 1.8V and 1.2V outputs.
    
    The 3.3V and 1.2V outputs are from switching supplies and can supply up to 1.5A each.  The 2.5V and 1.8V
    outputs are from LDO regulators which can supply 300mA each.  Refer to Table \ref{table:PowerSupplies} for 
    the distribution and approximate current consumption for that power supply.
